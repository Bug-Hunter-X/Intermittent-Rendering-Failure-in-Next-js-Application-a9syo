# Intermittent Rendering Failure in Next.js Application

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js application where the initial render fails intermittently, often after clearing the browser cache.  The cause is likely related to caching issues, and a potential solution is presented below.

## Bug

The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple Next.js component. However, upon initial load (especially after a cache refresh), it may fail to render correctly, sometimes showing a blank screen or other unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper handling of data fetching and caching. In this specific scenario, no data is being fetched, but the issue could be related to aggressive browser caching of the component.  The solution is a placeholder for addressing potential issues with caching or data fetching.
